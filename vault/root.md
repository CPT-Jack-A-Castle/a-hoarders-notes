## Welcome to A Hoarder's Notes

This is my digital garden where I hoard all the interesting things I learn about. Much like my actual garden, there's probably too much stuffed into it. It mostly contains links and information about tools that I find interesting or cool. Though there are some sections about gardening, project ideas, projects that I've worked on (and probably abandoned before completing), crypto, and mental health. It's quite a lot and might be overwhelming to sift through. Please take advantage of the search bar at the top of the site and -- if you're curious about the same sort of things -- slowly explore through the contents at your leisure.

**Note**: I'm in the process of migrating most of this out of [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) which has served me well for years. There are some limitations with it that have made it difficult to keep it integrated with my processes for note keeping and managing my days as they evolve.
