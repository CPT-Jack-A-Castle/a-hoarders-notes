I really like the idea of having a tool that centrally manages versions of
different applications. However, the number of available utilities is too small
to actually replace things like `brew`, `apt`, or even tools that are specific
to a particular utility such as `tfswitch` or `pyenv`.

While I could go through and create plugins to support more of what I need, the
time tha I have is precious and I'm already familiar with other package
management tools.
