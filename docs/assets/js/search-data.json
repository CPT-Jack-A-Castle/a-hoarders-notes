Much like my actual garden, there's probably too much stuffed into it. It mostly contains links and information about tools that I find interesting or cool. Though there are some sections about gardening, project ideas, projects that I've worked on (and probably abandoned before completing), crypto, and mental health. It's quite a lot and might be overwhelming to sift through. Please take advantage of the search bar at the top of the site and -- if you're curious about the same sort of things -- slowly explore through the contents at your leisure.\n\n**Note**: I'm in the process of migrating most of this out of [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) which has served me well for years.

For example: Changing the value of the `site.assetsPrefix` key didn't get picked up and I had to delete the `docs` directory and re-run the `Dendron: Site Build` command. Might be best to have the directory destroyed before building each time.\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Github\n\nEssentially the same as the notes in the [Dendron wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/230d0ccf-5758-4a8f-b39b-3b68e1482e2b.html).\n\n1. Create a user site following the guide on [Github](https://pages.github.com/).\n2. If one doesn't already exist, create a new repository on Github for your Dendron notes.\n3. Push your files up to the repository.\n4. Enable Github Pages for the repository using the `main` branch and the `docs` directory.\n5. Copy the site URL that it shows after you save. It should look something like: `https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/`.\n6. Edit the `dendron.yml` file adding the key `site.siteUrl` with the hostname of your site. For example, if the site URL that Github showed you when enabling Github Pages is `https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/` then the value for `site.siteUrl` would be: `https://mkell43.github.io`. See the example `dendron.yml` below.\n7. Add the path in the site URL that Github provided when enabling Github Pages to the `site.assetsPrefix` key in your `dendron.yml` file. For example, if the site URL they provided was `https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/` then the value for `site.assetsPrefix` would be: `a-hoarders-notes`. See the example `dendron.yml` below.\n8. Using the VSCode Command Pallette (`cmd/ctrl + shift + p`) run the `Dendron: Site Build` command.\n9. Git add, commit, and push your repository up to Github.\n\n#### Example dendron.yml\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: vault\nuseFMTitle: true\nuseNoteTitleForLink: true\nnoAutoCreateOnDefinition: true\nnoLegacyNoteRef: true\nnoXVaultWikiLink: true\nlookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: false\nautoFoldFrontmatter: true\njournal:\n    dailyDomain: daily\n    name: journal\n    dateFormat: y.MM.dd\n    addBehavior: childOfDomain\n    firstDayOfWeek: 1\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - root\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    title: A Hoarders Notes\n    description: Personal knowledge space\n    siteUrl: https://mkell43.github.io\n    assetsPrefix:  a-hoarders-notes\ninitializeRemoteVaults: true\n```\n","url":"https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/notes/nQeZ9Z8qdrslc_a_eBFHg.html","relUrl":"notes/nQeZ9Z8qdrslc_a_eBFHg.html"},{"doc":"Kubernetes Tools","title":"Kubernetes Tools","hpath":"tools.k8s","content":"\n## Kubernetes External Secrets\n\n<https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets>\n\n> Integrate external secret management systems with Kubernetes\n\n----\n\n## Collections\n\n[[#kubernetes|collections.k8s]]\n","url":"https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/notes/kn_KLbe7ISdtqATbQ_1L7.html","relUrl":"notes/kn_KLbe7ISdtqATbQ_1L7.html"},{"doc":"Git Tools","title":"Git Tools","hpath":"tools.git","content":"\n## Extensions\n\n### Commitzen\n\n<https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli>\n\nEnforce commit conventions.\n\n**GitHub Topic**: <https://github.com/topics/commitizen>\n\n#### Adapters\n\n**GitHub Topic**: <https://github.com/topics/commitizen-adapter>\n\n### Gitflow AVH\n\n<https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh>\n\n> AVH Edition of the git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model\n\n<http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>\n\n## Hooks\n\n### Awesome Lists\n\n- [aitemr/awesome-git-hooks](https://github.com/aitemr/awesome-git-hooks)\n\n### Talisman\n\n<https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman>\n\n> A tool to detect and prevent secrets from getting checked in.\n\n## Hook Frameworks\n\n### Pre-commit\n\n<https://pre-commit.com/>\n\n**GitHub Topic**: <https://github.com/topics/pre-commit>\n\n#### Hooks\n\n- <https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html>\n\n### Husky\n\n<https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/>\n\n**GitHub Topic**: <https://github.com/topics/husky>\n\n#### Hooks\n\n- Jira Prepare Commit Msg: <https://github.com/bk201-/jira-prepare-commit-msg>\n\n## Overcommit\n\n<https://github.com/sds/overcommit>\n\n> A fully configurable and extendable Git hook manager.\n\n## GitHub Topics\n\n- [git-hooks](https://github.com/topics/git-hooks)\n\n----\n\n## Collections\n\n[[#git|collections.git]]\n","url":"https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/notes/g-y817itcrGBAQB0nbxcK.html","relUrl":"notes/g-y817itcrGBAQB0nbxcK.html"},{"doc":"GitHub Actions Tools","title":"GitHub Actions Tools","hpath":"tools.gha","content":"\n## Actions\n\n## peaceiris/actions-gh-pages\n\n[peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)\n\n> GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages rocket Deploy static files and publish your\n> site easily.
