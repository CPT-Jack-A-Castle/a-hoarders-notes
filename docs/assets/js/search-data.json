Much like my actual garden, there's probably too much stuffed into it. It mostly contains links and information about tools that I find interesting or cool. Though there are some sections about gardening, project ideas, projects that I've worked on (and probably abandoned before completing), crypto, and mental health. It's quite a lot and might be overwhelming to sift through. Please take advantage of the search bar at the top of the site and -- if you're curious about the same sort of things -- slowly explore through the contents at your leisure.\n\n**Note**: I'm in the process of migrating most of this out of [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) which has served me well for years. There are some limitations with it that have made it difficult to keep it integrated with my processes for note keeping and managing my days as they evolve.\n","url":"https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes","relUrl":"/"},{"doc":"Toolbox","title":"Toolbox","hpath":"tools","content":"\nI can't help myself.

For example: Changing the value of the `site.assetsPrefix` key didn't get picked up and I had to delete the `docs` directory and re-run the `Dendron: Site Build` command. Might be best to have the directory destroyed before building each time.\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Github\n\nEssentially the same as the notes in the [Dendron wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/230d0ccf-5758-4a8f-b39b-3b68e1482e2b.html).\n\n1. Create a user site following the guide on [Github](https://pages.github.com/).\n2. If one doesn't already exist, create a new repository on Github for your Dendron notes.\n3. Push your files up to the repository.\n4. Enable Github Pages for the repository using the `main` branch and the `docs` directory.\n5. Copy the site URL that it shows after you save. It should look something like: `https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/`.\n6. Edit the `dendron.yml` file adding the key `site.siteUrl` with the hostname of your site. For example, if the site URL that Github showed you when enabling Github Pages is `https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/` then the value for `site.siteUrl` would be: `https://mkell43.github.io`. See the example `dendron.yml` below.\n7. Add the path in the site URL that Github provided when enabling Github Pages to the `site.assetsPrefix` key in your `dendron.yml` file. For example, if the site URL they provided was `https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/` then the value for `site.assetsPrefix` would be: `a-hoarders-notes`. See the example `dendron.yml` below.\n8. Using the VSCode Command Pallette (`cmd/ctrl + shift + p`) run the `Dendron: Site Build` command.\n9. Git add, commit, and push your repository up to Github.\n\n#### Example dendron.yml\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: vault\nuseFMTitle: true\nuseNoteTitleForLink: true\nnoAutoCreateOnDefinition: true\nnoLegacyNoteRef: true\nnoXVaultWikiLink: true\nlookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: false\nautoFoldFrontmatter: true\njournal:\n    dailyDomain: daily\n    name: journal\n    dateFormat: y.MM.dd\n    addBehavior: childOfDomain\n    firstDayOfWeek: 1\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - root\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    title: A Hoarders Notes\n    description: Personal knowledge space\n    siteUrl: https://mkell43.github.io\n    assetsPrefix:  a-hoarders-notes\ninitializeRemoteVaults: true\n```\n","url":"https://mkell43.github.io/a-hoarders-notes/notes/nQeZ9Z8qdrslc_a_eBFHg.html","relUrl":"notes/nQeZ9Z8qdrslc_a_eBFHg.html"},{"doc":"GitHub Actions","title":"GitHub Actions","hpath":"tools.gha","content":"\n## Make a Commit if Changes Are Staged\n\nDuring CI if changes are made during the process -- such as when building a static site -- the step below will commit them.
